""Generate a high-contrast urban nighttime scene with a sense of tension and foreboding. The environment is a dark, narrow alleyway with rough, weathered concrete walls that have a subtle texture, almost like the roughness of worn stone. The time of day is late, with the only light sources being dim, flickering streetlights that cast long, ominous shadows on the ground. The streetlights are positioned at irregular intervals, casting an eerie, unsettling glow over the scene.

The pavement is wet and glistening, reflecting the vibrant, pulsing colors of neon lights from nearby buildings like a broken, shattered mirror. These neon lights are a deep, electric blue and green, but they're reflected in the wet pavement as a jumbled mess of colors, creating a sense of visual dissonance.

In the center of the image, a fire hydrant stands like a sentinel, its metal body reflecting the dim light in a dull, rusty sheen. Nearby, two trash cans are overturned, spilling their contents across the pavement in a tangled mess of discarded paper, broken glass, and torn plastic. Debris is scattered everywhere, including shattered bottles, torn fabric, and crumpled up paper.

The atmosphere is tense and foreboding, with an undercurrent of anxiety and unease. The air is heavy with the smell of exhaust fumes, garbage, and something else - something acrid and bitter. The sound of distant sirens can be heard, their flashing lights casting an otherworldly glow over the scene.

The artistic style should be high-contrast, with bold, heavy shadows that seem to swallow the light. The colors should be muted, but the neon reflections on the pavement should be vibrant and eye-catching. The overall effect should be a sense of unease and disquiet, like something is lurking just out of sight, waiting to pounce.

In terms of composition, the viewer's eye should be drawn to the center of the image, where the fire hydrant stands like a focal point. The trash cans and debris should be scattered around it, creating a sense of chaos and disorder. The alleyway should be narrow and claustrophobic, with the walls closing in on the viewer like a prison.

The image should be rendered in high detail, with every texture and surface treated with a sense of realism. The lighting should be complex and nuanced, with every shadow and highlight carefully calculated to create a sense of depth and dimensionality. The overall effect should be a haunting, unforgettable image that lingers in the viewer's mind long after they've looked away.""

This prompt should give the AI image generation tool a clear idea of what to aim for in terms of environment, lighting, colors, textures, and atmosphere, and should result in a highly detailed and visually rich image that captures the mood and tone of the description."
